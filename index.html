<p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made mainly from fermented vegetables,most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radish, seasoned with a variety of 
    spices and ingredients such as chili pepper, garlic, ginger, scallions, and salted seafood. It has a distinctive spicy, tangy, and umami flavor 
    that comes from the process of lactic acid fermentation.</p>

    <h2>Main Ingredients of Kimchi</h2>
    
<ul>
Napa cabbage    
Korean Radish

Chili Pepper Powder

Garlic

Ginger

Scallions (Green onions / Spring onions)

Salted Seafood 

Salt
</ul>

<p>1.Prepare the cabbage

Cut the Napa cabbage into quarters, then chop into bite-sized pieces.

Soak the pieces in salted water  for about 2–3 hours, turning occasionally.

Rinse with clean water and drain well.</p>

<p>2.Prepare the paste

In a bowl, mix garlic, ginger, chili pepper powder, sugar, and fish 
sauce into a thick paste.</p>

<p>3. Add vegetables

Cut the radish into thin matchstick pieces and chop scallions.

Add them to the spice paste and mix well.</p>

<p>4. Combine with cabbage

Put the drained cabbage into a large bowl.

Add the spice mixture and use your hands (wear gloves) to coat each 
piece of cabbage thoroughly.</p>

<p>5. Ferment
Pack the mixture tightly into a clean glass jar, pressing down so there are no air gaps.

Leave the jar at room temperature for 1–2 days to start fermentation.</p>

<p>Then store in the refrigerator. Kimchi will continue to ferment and develop flavor.

1 cup glutinous rice flour (also called mochiko) ¾ cup water ¼ cup sugar Cornstarch or potato starch (for dusting)

Optional filling: red bean paste, chocolate, or ice cream</ul>


<p>Mix the batter

In a microwave-safe bowl, combine glutinous rice flour, water, and sugar.

Stir until smooth (no lumps).</p>

Microwave for 1 minute, stir, then microwave again for 1–2 minutes until it becomes thick and sticky.

(If using a steamer: steam the mixture for about 15 minutes until it turns translucent.)</p>



<p>Prepare the surface

Sprinkle cornstarch or potato starch on a clean surface to prevent sticking.</p>
